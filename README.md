## Languages

This repo consists of the boilerplate and setup for 3 languages:

* Kotlin
* Python
* Typescript

There are 3 branches with the relevant scaffolding. Clone this repo and checkout the appropriate branch for the language you are using.

## Step 1

Step one provides you with the `feature` file and step definitions. You are asked to complete the code to make the tests pass.

## Step 2

Step 2 asks you to work together to create the `feature` file with the appropriate scenarios. You will then write step definitions and the relevant code to make the tests pass.

## Step 3

In Step 3 you are given an incomplete `feature` file and are expected to work together to come up with additional scenarios. You will then write the step definitions and the relevant code to make the tests pass.

## Kotlin Section

This template is setup to use with IntelliJ IDEA. To install the dependencies open the folder in IntelliJ and refresh the gradle project. You can then run the tests from the IDE by going to the feature file and using the green run button.
