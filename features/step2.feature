# Mr.Bean.Counter - "Great job with the ROS files! You know what, I think we can start 
# collecting more interesting information about these sales if we do some post processing 
# on the ROS files. It would be nice if we could categorize the items to be able to spot
# trends in which type of categories our customers are most interested in.
# I have supplied you with a list containing the items and their categories. 
# I would like your program to output a line per category with that categoryâ€™s 
# total sales, as well as a line for the grand total across all categories. 


#For example:

# wheat and pasta: 10
# fruit: 20
# dairy: 40
# meat: 30
# total: 100

# The new ROS file will be like this:
# wheat and pasta, bread, 1, 2
# dairy, 12-pack of eggs, 1, 2
# dairy, milk (1L), 4, 8
# sodas, coca cola (33cl), 10, 10
# meat, chicken clubs (frozen), 1, 4
# greens, carrots, 4, 1
# fruit, apples (red, 1Kg bag), 1, 2.5
# dairy, butter (500 g), 3, 6
# dairy, cheese (1Kg), 1, 7
# meat, bacon ("tasty" brand, 3 pack), 2, 7
# drinks, orange juice (1L), 2, 3
# dairy, cheese (gouda, 1Kg), 1, 5
# drinks, bottled water (1.5L), 5, 5
# candy, twix (1 whole box, 3 rows, 5 per row), 1, 20
# meat, sirloin (100g), 1, 30
# greens, tomatoes, 12, 3
# fruit, bananas, 3, 1
